# Example Question
- When there is a general question about testing an engineer's experience towards the application would be a deep dive into the architecture. We would to ask the developer how they will be designing an example platform which can be scalable and secure.

## Design a scalable platform
### Product requirements
- Authentication
- Data collection
- Visualization
- Payment system
- System Consistency
- Types of data

### How are we communicating inside the platform?
- Public endpoints(login, payment, view etc.)
- Private/Internal endpoints(update user data)
- Designing databases/data schema(either relational or non-relational)

### High level architecture
- How do we communicate within the UI, backend servers and databases?
- Are we using load balancers?
- Any read replicas for faster response times?
- High availability vs low cost
- Data sharding

### What are the challenges and tradeoffs of using this architecture?
